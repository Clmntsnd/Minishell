# Minishell

## Overview

Minishell is a minimalistic shell implemented as part of the 42 curriculum. It aims to replicate some functionalities of the bash shell, providing a platform to understand the underlying processes and interactivity of a Unix shell.

## Features

- Command execution
- Built-in commands: `echo`, `cd`, `unset`, `env`, `exit`, `export`, `pwd`.
- History
- Signal management (`ctrl-C`, `ctrl-D`)
- Implementations of pipes (`|`) redirections (`>`, `>>`, `<`) and heredoc (`<<`)
- Environment variable expansion with `$`
- And many more...

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- GCC
- Make

### Installation

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/Clmntsnd/Minishell`
2. Enter the directory: `cd minishell`

## Usage

Once you've started the shell, you can use it as you would a basic Unix shell.
